;;; Commentary:

;; Gogs is a library that provides basic support for using the Gogs API
;; from Emacs packages.  It abstracts access to API resources using only
;; a handful of functions that are not resource-specific.

;; This library is implemented on top of Ghub.  Unlike Ghub, Gogs does
;; not support the guided creation of tokens because Gogs lacks the
;; features that would be necessary to implement that.  Users have to
;; create tokens through the web interface.

;;; Code:

(require 'ghub)

(defconst gogs-default-host "localhost:3000/api/v1"
  "The default Gogs host.")

;; HEAD does not appear to be supported.
